# Expression variation of promoters.
## Christ Leemans, 06-03-2017

## Introduction
We previously saw that promoters that escape lamina interaction show expression in a lot of different tissues. A promoter was considered expressed in a cell type when the CAGE was higher than 1. This was a really quick way to get to some idea of house-keeping function. However it does not say all about how the promoter is regulated across different cell types. In this report I would like to focus on measuring the variation of promoter expression across the fantom CAGE data.

        y = grep(x, association)
